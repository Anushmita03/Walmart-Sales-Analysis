# ðŸ›’ Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis of Walmart sales using Python for cleaning, SQL for querying, and structured problem-solving to derive business insights. It uses Python, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy to handle data processing, storage, and complex query analysis.

## ðŸš€ Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment

* **Tools Used:** VS Code, Python, MySQL
* **Goal:** Organize workspace and set up development environment.

### 2. Set Up Kaggle API

* Downloaded `kaggle.json` from Kaggle account settings.
* Placed it in the `.kaggle` folder on our system.
* Used:

  ```bash
  kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>
  ```

  to download data.

### 3. Download Walmart Sales Data

* Data Source: Used the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
* Dataset Link: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)
* Saved the dataset in the `data/` folder.

### 4. Install Required Libraries & Load Data

Libraries: Installed necessary Python libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python
```

* Loading Data: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

### 5. Data Exploration

* Goal: Conducted an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
* Analysis: Used functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.head()` to explore the data.

### 6. Data Cleaning

* Remove Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
* Handle Missing Values: Dropped rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
* Fix Data Types: Ensured all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as datetime, prices as float).
* Currency Formatting: Used .replace() to handle and format currency values for analysis.
* Validation: Checked for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 7. Feature Engineering

* Create New Columns: Calculated the Total Amount for each transaction by multiplying unit_price by quantity and adding this as a new column( `Total Amount` column = `unit_price * quantity`)
* Enhance Dataset: Adding this calculated field streamlined further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

### 8. Load Data into MySQL

* Set Up Connections: Connected to MySQL using sqlalchemy and load the cleaned data into each database.
* Table Creation: Set up tables in MySQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
* Verification: Ran initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

### 9. SQL Analysis

Business Problem-Solving: Wrote and executed complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
* Revenue trends across branches and categories.
* Identifying best-selling product categories.
* Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
* Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
* Create tables and insert cleaned data
* Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
Documentation: Kept clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.
